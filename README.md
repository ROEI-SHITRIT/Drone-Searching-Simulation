# Drone Searching Simulation

## Project Overview
This project, developed as part of a Bachelor's in Computer Science, demonstrates expertise in object-oriented design, C++ programming, and data structures. It simulates drones navigating a forest to reach a target point under specific constraints.

## Key Features
- Object-oriented design with multiple inheritance and polymorphism.
- Binary tree implementation with recursive operations.
- File-based configuration and validation.
- Simulation of dynamic drone behaviors and target tracking.

## How It Works
1. **Input Files**:
   - **File 1**: Forest boundaries, target point, and simulation iterations.
   - **File 2**: Drone details (type, initial position, speed).
2. **Output File**:
   - Final drone positions and the count of drones that reached the target.

## Highlights
- Dynamic data structure for managing drones.
- Efficient recursive algorithms for tree operations.
- Robust error handling and scalability.

## How to Run
1. Compile: `g++ main.cpp -o drone_simulation`
2. Execute: `./drone_simulation <input_file_1> <input_file_2>`
